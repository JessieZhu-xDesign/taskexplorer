## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Bright cyan (#34B7EB) to convey energy and playfulness.
- Background color: Pale cyan (#E5F6FD). Provides a soft background that doesn't distract from the tasks.
- Accent color: Sunny orange (#FF851B).  Used for interactive elements, like buttons and toggles.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font suitable for all text.
- Use large, colorful, and simple icons to represent task actions (e.g., checkmark for done, trashcan for delete).
- Keep the layout extremely simple with large buttons and plenty of spacing to accommodate small hands and developing motor skills.
- Use simple animations, such as sliding tasks or fade-in effects, to provide visual feedback and engagement upon task completion or deletion.
