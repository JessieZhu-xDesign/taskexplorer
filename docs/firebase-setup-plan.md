# Plan to Connect Application to Firebase DB

## 1. Set Up Firebase Project
- Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Create a new Firebase project or use an existing one

## 2. Add Firebase to Your Web App
- In the Firebase Console, register your app and obtain the Firebase config object

## 3. Install Firebase SDK
- Run `npm install firebase` in your project directory

## 4. Configure Firebase in Your Project
- Create a new file (e.g., `src/lib/firebase.ts`) to initialize Firebase using the config object

## 5. Set Up Firestore Database
- In the Firebase Console, enable Firestore Database
- Choose production or test mode as appropriate

## 6. Implement Data Access Functions
- Create functions in `src/lib/firebase.ts` or a new file to read/write data to Firestore

## 7. Integrate Firebase Functions in Components
- Use the data access functions in your React components (e.g., task list, add task form)

## 8. Secure Your Database
- Set up Firestore security rules in the Firebase Console

## 9. Test Integration
- Verify that your app can read/write data to Firebase

## 10. (Optional) Set Up Authentication
- Enable Firebase Authentication if you need user login
- Update your app to use authentication features
